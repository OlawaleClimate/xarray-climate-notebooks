# xarray-climate-notebooks

## Description


This repository contains several notebooks with examples of how to apply Pangeo tools (e.g. Xarray, Dask, cartopy.) to climate science problems. First, Let's start with computation of modes of climate variablity. More examples to be added.

## Software Packages

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - ![Python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OlawaleClimate/awesome-open-climate-science/master/media/icon/python.png) Data structures and data analysis tools for tabular datasets
